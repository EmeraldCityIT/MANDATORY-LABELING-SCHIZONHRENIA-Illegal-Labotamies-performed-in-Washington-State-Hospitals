Doctors will ask a series of questions to identify target areas of the brain on a computer image. A cattle-killing device, similar to the one used on "No country for old men" is then used on the victim to disable the active portion of the brain during an active interview. The victim is left disabled, impaired, and immediately labeled as schizophrenic.  Hospitals who perform these illegal operations place MANDATORY SCHITZOPHRENIC labeling for patients who survive the lobotomy process.

This process is used to create job openings in target companies and government offices.
